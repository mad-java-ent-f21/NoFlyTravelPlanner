Before class officially started: read videos (that doesn't sound right, but it's what I do. I read the transcrip
and refer to the visual elements only when I need to.)

Week 1. Major struggle to get the enviroment working on the host, but that was a concious choice, not done because
I didn't like Ubuntu.  Using Intellij on Windows means having one enviroment for The Fortress and Enterprise Java.

Week 2. (Up to class day, struggled to get Indie started in Intellij and github, finally succeeded with Paula's 
help during work time.)  After this I intend to make daily enteries, but some days I will focus on The Fortress, so
there will be no Enterprise Java entry.

Week 3. Once again I didn't make daily entries - no excuse.  On the other hand, I finished Week 3 Thursday, focused 
on The Fortress Friday, and read all readings and video transcripts Saturday.

Week 4. Drafted everything that needed to be shown to the class on Sunday.  Class Wednesday.  Tried to
submit over the weekend, but the .md files were not in the correct location, and Paula did not look
for them or grade them.  Doing that now.

Week 5. Saturday, watched videos.  Sunday, tried to get the database working in hibernate, got very 
confused.  Took a break Monday.  Tuesday, re-reading videos to try to figure out what I missed.
