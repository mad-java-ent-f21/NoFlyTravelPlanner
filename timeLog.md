Before class officially started: read videos (that doesn't sound right, but it's what I do. I read the transcrip
and refer to the visual elements only when I need to.)

Week 1. Major struggle to get the enviroment working on the host, but that was a concious choice, not done because
I didn't like Ubuntu.  Using Intellij on Windows means having one enviroment for The Fortress and Enterprise Java.

Week 2. (Up to class day, struggled to get Indie started in Intellij and github, finally succeeded with Paula's 
help during work time.)  After this I intend to make daily enteries, but some days I will focus on The Fortress, so
there will be no Enterprise Java entry.

Week 3. Once again I didn't make daily entries - no excuse.  On the other hand, I finished Week 3 Thursday, focused 
on The Fortress Friday, and read all readings and video transcripts Saturday.

Week 4. Drafted everything that needed to be shown to the class on Sunday.  Class Wednesday.  Tried to
submit over the weekend, but the .md files were not in the correct location, and Paula did not look
for them or grade them.  Doing that now.

Week 5. Saturday, watched videos.  Sunday, tried to get the database working in hibernate, got very 
confused.  Took a break Monday.  Tuesday, re-reading videos to try to figure out what I missed.

Week 6. Vacation.  Away from home with very simple laptop, could not compile.  Read as far ahead as available on
Sunday and Monday evenings.  Did some research for 

Week 7. Met with Heather from DRS Wednesday in hope of finding a way forward.  Three weeks behind on hands-on
work.  Stuck with DAO issues, tests failing.  

Week 8. Breakthrough, although what changed enough to feel like a miracle happened in The Fortress initially. 
The Honors Project has a simpler database, one table with no foreign keys to worry about, and that made both
the planning and the DOA easier to build out.  Having done it once (Sunday, on The Fortress) I was able to 
non-working tests and methods in this class with the working code on The Fortress and get the basic database
functionality to work.  Propery time log will start from Tuesday:
    Tuesday: I spent about 2.5 hours finishing up the  Professional Development presentation.  (This 
was one of the things I researched while on vacation, so I had the information, but I needed to 
update it already because Windows 11 was released the day I returned from the trip, meaning a lot 
of new information available in the days that followed.  Most of what I did Tuesday was 
getting the slideshow presentable, and practicing.)
    Wednesday: Class, including presentation.
    Thurday: Honors Project.  (I generally don't work on both at on the same night, unless I'm using code in
one project to help debug the other.  After this, I will only list days where I did some Enterprise Java work.)
    Friday: Minimal.  Spent about 15 minutes looking up how to override the equals() method from class Object.
