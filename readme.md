People may have many reasons for wanting to travel but not wanting to fly.  If neither a staycation nor an 
airplane trip is desired, there are few online resources broad enough to explore the options - car, bus, train, boat.
This site is a multi-function resource for those people.

Non-motorized travel - foot, bike, horse, boats that drift downriver or depend on sail - are out of scope, however.
These options are so slow as to be impractical unless that activity is the primary reason for the trip.  

I may attempt to consider vacation travel by electric car, although that is a stretch goal, not part of MVP.
Electric cars can reach highway speeds, but their range is shorter than gas powered cars, and charging stations
are not as common as gas stations.  Also, it takes longer to charge a battery then to fill a gas tank, so part of 
the trip plan will include what the people will be doing while the car recharges.  

Four use cases emerge from this idea:

1. Find an enjoyable vacation destination within a moderate driving distance from home.
2. Plan a multi-day road trip.
3. Comparing transportation options, including car, bus, train or boat.
4. Find travel ideas from other user's stories.

Technologies include Java, a mySQL database, hibernate, and front-end markup and coding
in HTML, CSS and Flexbox.
