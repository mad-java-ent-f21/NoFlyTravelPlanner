Week 5 Add new user, display list of users.  - Missed date, but now working.

Week 6 Time out from Java to get the visuals up!  HTML, CSS and either flexbox or bootstrap, TBD. -  Missed
date, but now working.

Week 7 Update user information, temporary version of deleting a user so there is full CRUD on one table in 
time for checkpoint 2.  Actually got most of this done on time.  Paula wanted me to change my professional 
development topic away from penetration testing, because that wouldn't be new to me.  The new topic, Windows 11,
is new to everybody, including Paula!  In the topic change, the date was moved to Week 8.

Week 8 Professional development presentation.  Catch up on weekly work.

Week 9 Deploy to AWS.  Complete the rest of the database with SQL, meaning destination/activity table (one, the
difference is an instance variable) User-post has a one-to-many relation, as does post-destination, so post is
in some ways a bridge table, but has significant content of it's own. Research API for route planner feature, to
be built out in Week 11.

Week 10 Add search by location or activity.

Week 11 Add route planner feature.  Consumes web service, maybe Google maps.  Should also check for train,
bus and boat options as applicable.  

Week 12 Try to add flagging or some kind of complaint feature.  This is a bit vague at this point, but the
idea is that a registered user can note a travel story or post if something is wrong.  This could be as simple
as an outdated price to something that the site explicitly states is forbidden, such as mentioning prostitutes.

Week 13 If I make any attempt to get separation of duties to work, this is the time.  The concept is that no 
one admin can kick a user off the site, no matter what the reason.  (One admin can delete a post.)  Marking 
which admin has already started the process is simple, as is allowing any other admin to finish the job.  What's
hard is unit testing a two-step process.

Week 14 Catch up, test and debug.  No more features added this late.
