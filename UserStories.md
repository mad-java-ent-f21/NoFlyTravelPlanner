Comment on other peoples stories
As a registered user, I want to comment on what other people post.

Report misuse
As a registered user, I want to tell an administrator if a post is outdated or false, or if abusive language 
appears on the site.

Request password reset
As a registered user, I may need to request a password reset. I will not be logged in when this happens, but
I will know the email address I used to register. This site does not have a self-service password recovery, 
but may allow a user to notify an admin and request a temporary password.

Remove or edit my own posts
As a registered user, I may need to change something I have already posted, rather to correct an error or 
take down a recommendation if the destination is permenantly closed.*

Flag or delete posts
As an admin, I need to be able to alert other users of potential problems, flagging the post for minor issues
such as outdated prices, or removing a post for something more serious, such as ethnic slurs or posting about 
a brothal.  This site does not permit posts about prostitution (even where legal) or any controled drug, 
including marijuana.

Remove user
If two admins agree that a person has flagrantly misused the site, they can remove the user, but separation of
duties applies.  Stretch goal.  This comes from when I was planning to do The Fortress in Enterprise Java, but
I like the challenge of separation of duties because of the two-step process that would need to be covered in
unit tests.

Reset users password
As an admin, I will need to reset passwords if users forget them.
