People may have many reason for wanting to travel but not wanting to fly.  If neither a staycation nor an 
trip is desired, there are few online resources broad enough to explore the options - car, bus, train, boat.
This site is a multi-function resource for those people.
Non-motorized travel - foot, bike, horse, boats that drift downriver or depend on sail - are out of scope, however.
These options are so slow as to be impractical unless that activity is the primary reason for the trip.  People who
take week-long horseback trips are not focused on reaching the destination, but on bonding with the animals and 
spending time away from modern routines.  Unless they live in an area suitable for riding on roads, they will need
to transport their animals and equipment to whereever they plan to begin their ride.  The logistic of that is
beyond the scope of this site.
I may attempt to consider vacation travel by electric car, although that is a stretch goal, not part of MVP.
Electric cars can reach highway speeds, but their range is shorter than gas powered cars, and charging stations
are not as common as gas stations.  Also, it takes longer to charge a battery then to fill a gas tank, so part of 
the trip plan will include what the people will be doing while the car recharges.  If the car is a hybred, what
a vacation trip will look like depends on the traveler's priorities.  If they consider the gasoline engine as
a last resort if they can't find a place to charge the battery, it will be more like an all-electric except that
margins can be cut a bit closer because the gas motor is there.  On the other hand, if they are more willing to
use gas and charge the battery only when convenient, it will be more like a road trip in a regular gas-burning
car.
Four use cases emerge from this idea:
1. Find an enjoyable vacation destination within a moderate driving distance from home.
2. Plan a multi-day road trip.
3. Comparing transportation options, including car, bus, train or boat.
4. Find travel ideas from other user's stories.
