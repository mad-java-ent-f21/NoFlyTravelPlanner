        <h3>What is this site about?</h3>
        <p>You don't have to drive - unless you want to.  Depending
            on where you're going, there may be train, bus, or boat options.</p>
        <p><strong>We don't judge.</strong>Before the pandemic, a survey of our users showed that 70% abstain
            from flying for enviromental reasons, such as reducing their carbon footprint.  That means a significant
            minority of our users have other reasons and that's fine too.  Our purpose is to help you get where you
            want to go without flying/</p>
