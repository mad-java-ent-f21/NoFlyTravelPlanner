        <p>The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.</p>

        <h3>What is this site about?</h3>
        <p>You don't have to drive - unless you want to.  Depending
            on where you're going, there may be train, bus, or boat options.</p>
        <p><strong>We don't judge.</strong>Before the pandemic, a survey of our users showed that 70% abstain
            from flying for enviromental reasons, such as reducing their carbon footprint.  That means a significant
            minority of our users have other reasons and that's fine too.  Our purpose is to help you get where you
            want to go without flying/</p>

        <h1>Welcome to The Fortress!</h1>
        <h3>What is this site about?</h3>
        <p>The Fortress is a proof-of-concept secure website.  If the data concerned real people, it would be considered Personally Identifiable Information - PII.  Such data is a target for criminals, and a priority for owners to protect.  Of course, the "staff" in this database are entirely fictional, and therefore useless to the criminal.  The data is a goal for the site to defend, and therefore it is also the objective for anyone testing the site.</p>
        <p><strong>This is not a Capture-The-Flag cybergame. </strong>A CTF site has specific vulnerabilities included for people learning to run security tests, and perhaps available to curious amatures who want to try their knowledge of hacking without breaking the law.  Several such games exist, including National Cyber League and SANS.ORG Netwars challenges.  The Fortress did not leave vulnerabilities intentionally, and therefore it is far more difficult to hack then a CTF.</p>
        <p>What The Fortress has in common with CTF games is that it is legal to attack - if you follow the rules.  Ethical hackers work within a contractual scope when running security tests.  This challenge doesn't have a written contract, but there are still rules of ethical hacking that apply.  More details is on the Rules page.</p>

        <h4>What is Simulated Here?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The Fortress simulates a service that provides payroll and tax record keeping for small businesses. Such employers may lack the resources to store and secure critical data such as Social Security and bank account numbers.</li>
            <li>Although the data is not real, the security features on the site are similar to what such a business would actually use.</li>
            <li>Staff members serviced by The Fortress, and even business owners, have limited access to the data.  The security principle of least privilige means they can do what they need to do, and nothing more.</li>
