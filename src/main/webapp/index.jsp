        <h3>What is this site about?</h3>
        <p>We are here to help you get where you want to go.  You don't have to drive - unless you want to.
            Depending on where you're going, there may be train, bus, or boat options.</p>
        <p><strong>We don't judge.  </strong>Before the pandemic, a survey of our users showed that 70% abstain
            from flying for enviromental reasons, such as reducing their carbon footprint.  That means a significant
            minority of our users have other reasons for not flying, and that's fine too.  Our purpose is to
            help you explore your options.</p>
