Pattison State Park in northern Wisconsin is best known for two scenic waterfalls, Big Manitou and Little Manitou.  It also offers hiking, camping and swimming.  Highway 35 and the Black River divide the park into several areas, and this can be confusing on a first visit.  Always carry a map when hiking and allow ample time on trails unfamiliar to you.  Many people enjoy wading in the Black River below Little Manitou Falls, but it is rocky and the current can be strong, depending on recent rainfall.  The safest place to get wet is the marked beach.
Located along a highway less then a half hour from Duluth, this is a comfortable day trip from several areas, including Minneapolis and the surrounding area.  There is apple space for picnicking and outdoor games.  Camping is less desirable, although there is a campground, the sites are packed  too close together, making for a noisy enviroment that doesn’t seem as natural as newer, more spread-out camping areas.  For multi-day trips in this area, consider St. Croix State Park in Minnesota, or Copper Falls State park farther east.
