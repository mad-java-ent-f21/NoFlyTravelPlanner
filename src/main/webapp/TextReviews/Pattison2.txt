Although best known for waterfalls, Pattison State Park also has a small backpack campground about 1.6 miles from the parking area.  This modest hike is ideal for beginners, and families with children too young to carry a full load.  
My wife and I were new to the backpack experience, and we took this one to test our gear before a more challenging trek on the North Country Trail next spring.  I’m glad we did, because there are items we didn’t have that we will add to our packing list.  Bear spray is the main one.  The animal didn’t get real close, but we were alone in the woods with a creature that probably weighs more than the two of us together.  It was a little scary!
